# Lab-Website-S3
Creating a Website on S3

In this lab, you practice using AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) commands from an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance to:

Create an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.

Create a new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user that has full access to the Amazon S3 service.

Upload files to Amazon S3 to host a simple website for the Caf√© & Bakery.

Create a batch file that can be used to update the static website when you change any of the website files locally.
